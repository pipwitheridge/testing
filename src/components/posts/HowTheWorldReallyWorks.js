I read this book because it was recommended on a few top-seller lists and I was interested in reading a bit about climate change from an expert in energy and environmental change. In a nutshell, Vaclav Smil takes an almost obsessively data-oriented approach to thinking about the way the world works, beginning by looking at the primary chemicals that fuel our world, and finishing by looking at the current debate around climate change policy. 
</p>

<p>
Vaclav gives his basic assessment early on: “our civilization is so deeply reliant on fossil fuels that the next transition will take much longer than most people think.” While Smil recognises the need to move from our dependence on the energies that made the modern world, he believes a sudden abandonment of fossil carbon cannot happen. What he foresees and hopes for is a gradual decline. 
</p>

<p>
Along the way, Smil drops some fascinating data points. The total energy requirement from start to finish to put a kilogram of roasted chicken on the dinner table is 300-350mL of crude oil: a remarkably efficient performance considering bread comes in at 200-250mL of crude oil per kilogram produced. Even more surprising is that to produce a kilogram of tomatoes requires about 650mL worth! This to say that vegetarian diets, while better on average than meaty diets when it comes to energy consumption, needs certain disclaimers. The ocean doesn’t fare well in this exercise: the mean for all seafood is about 700mL—nearly a full wine bottle of diesel fuel!
</p>

Smil argues that an important way to reduce our energy consumption is to curb our food production: “there are no good reasons for maintaining our excessive food production with its attendant food waste.” While many high-income countries produce about 100Kg of meat per person per year, we don’t need nearly that much. Japan, the country with the world’s highest longevity {'\u0028'}even though one in five adults smoke{'\u0029'}, has recently been recorded as eating less than 30kg of meat per person per year. He continues asking probing questions about the way we consume food: “Is it necessary to airlift blueberries from Peru to Canada in January, and green beans from Kenya to London?”.
</p>

Smil criticizes the way governments and businesses conjure up magical years—2030, 2035, 2050—by which we’ll be at net zero in our carbon emissions. He crunches the numbers to show that the emission reductions by some affluent countries are being negated by the rapid rise in emissions made by many developing countries, and it’ll be that way for some time. Smil argues for a more realistic approach—“being agnostic about the distant future means being honest”—and says that rather than expecting our emission reductions to come from cleverly-designed government policy initiatives, we should expect that ongoing emissions reductions will continue to be the bi-product of technological advances {'\u0028'}higher conversion efficiencies, more nuclear and hydro generation, less wasteful processing and manufacturing procedures{'\u0029'}. He gives two very practical ways that societies can drive cultural shifts towards emission reductions: don’t buy SUVs, and improve building codes in colder countries so that people have to install better window panes which keep in warmth {'\u0028'}reducing the need for heating to be left on all the time{'\u0029'}. 
</p>

<p>
I find it hard to tell if and where Smil gets it wrong {'\u0028'}at multiple points I have to simply trust his interpretation of the data available{'\u0029'}, but for me a few things stood out from this book which I think might affect my life. For one thing, I need to be more aware of my own energy usage—particularly around electricity use (fans and air conditioning). I also need to think about how much meat I consume, and try to consume less. From the perspective of ministry work I think there are lessons to be had here too—that when people have competing ideas about what Christians ought to do to help fight climate change, we need to do the best we can to look at the available data, be realistic in what we expect of individuals, and not to be too certain about what the future holds. This area, as in all areas, is one where we should exercise individual humility and patience with one another.
</p>

<p>
I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to think about climate with the help of an expert in energy and environmental change—an expert with a gift for telling stories with numbers.
