According to the latest census data, for every 10,000 people in Australia, 50 are homeless.

I read this book hoping to get a better picture of homelessness in Australia. As someone who’s worked in a few churches, I know that churches have some power—money, volunteers, resources—to help the homeless. I’ve seen it in action: someone has presented as homeless and church members have provided them with short-term housing, letting them stay for a few weeks at a time. When this happens, it demonstrates something great: genuine love for people in need, from people motivated by God’s love for them.

The question is what happens next. The answer is rarely {'\u0028'}if ever{'\u0029'} easy. But if we can better understand homelessness generally, we’ll be better placed to know how to help.

With contributions from experts in social research and homelessness policy, <i>Homelessness in Australia: An Introduction</i> explores the big issues in play. It outlines different theories of the causes of homelessness: there’s the view that people become homeless primarily because of <i>personal</i> factors—bad life choices, poor mental health, and others. Then there’s the view that people become homeless primarily because of <i>structural</i>  factors—a failure of the housing market, a failure of assistance programs. The book argues that the best improvements in homelessness policy have happened when leaders recognise the deep structural causes of homelessness and seek to address them, rather than simply placing blame on people who experience homelessness.

How countries should define homelessness and count their homeless is debated. It took a while for victims of domestic violence to be counted among the homeless, but it’s a good thing they are now. Despite having a house available to stay in, if it is not safe and it’s only used because there’s nowhere else to go, it is not a home. It is mere shelter. Additionally, you can be homeless even if you don’t ‘sleep rough’ out on the streets. The book explains these concepts well, and it also highlights the unique effects of homelessness on women, youth, and the elderly. It also talks helpfully about trauma and its effects on the homeless.

One note: if you’re looking for a book with stories or interviews from homeless people, this isn’t the book. Rather than offering the stories of particular homeless people, this book takes a broad academic approach.

For me, the most eye-opening chapter was the penultimate chapter about the failure of the housing system, written by Sarah Toohey {'\u0028'}CEO of <a href="https://www.chiavic.com.au/">Community Housing Industry Association Victoria</a>{'\u0029'}. She argues that one of the big issues is the lack of ‘exit points’ out of homelessness. There is not enough affordable housing for low-income earners, in part because government policy aims at increasing house prices, not decreasing them. This is not surprising: in Australia, most adults {'\u0028'}<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/housing/housing-census/2021">66% as of the 2021 census</a>{'\u0029'} own property, and anyone who owns property wants its value to increase, and therefore any prospective government who wants votes will need policies which increase house prices. This desire for increased home value is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is a reality. Rather than trying to unravel policies aimed at increasing house prices, Toohey suggests two policy initiatives that could firm up housing supply for the poor: a housing bond for large-scale investment in rental housing and the introduction of a broad-based land tax. This would help NGOs enter the housing market, backed by government, to provide better affordable housing.

There’s lots more to this book and I recommend it to anyone interested, but Toohey’s chapter got me thinking about whether churches could have this as part of their ministry mix—buying some simple apartments, renting them out not-for-profit to low-income earners, with possible subsidies for those who can’t afford the cost price, while helping the tenants save money and find jobs if needed. I'm not sure to what extent organisations like Anglicare are involved in this sort of work—that's something I need to check out.

Like most important issues facing Australia, homelessness has no easy answer. But if you’re interested in thinking creatively about how churches can better assist the homeless, I found this book a helpful introduction.
