I read this book because it was recommended by many people. I also read it because it promises to tackle a topic which many find difficult: complementarianism in practice. Long story short—it didn’t disappoint. It gets practical while doing justice to the theology of complementarianism.
</p>
<p>
Co-authored by Graham Beynon and Jane Tooher {'\u0028'}one of our lecturers at Moore College{'\u0029'}, the book defines complementarianism as <em>”the belief that God made men and women equal and distinctive: equal in value and dignity, and distinctive in responsibilities and roles.”</em> The idea that men and women are equal in value/dignity is sadly rejected by many in our world who either view men as superior to women, or vice versa. Unfortunately, even some churches fail to uphold the equal value and dignity of men and women—whether consciously or unconsciously. 
</p>
<p>
For many, the idea that men and women are equal in value and dignity is not controversial. What <em>is</em> controversial is the idea that men and women have distinct responsibilities and roles. In a culture where many view men and women as only differentiated by biological traits {'\u0028'}although even this is challenged by some{'\u0029'}, the notion that men and women have different God-given responsibilities is not a popular one. Many churches {'\u0028'}and church leaders{'\u0029'} struggle to deal with these cultural forces. Some churches react by going with the flow of these forces. Some churches react by doubling down on unhelpful, unbiblical ideas that men and women are distinct in value.
</p>
<p>
What we need, as this book argues, are churches who understand, embrace, communicate, and live out the Biblical distinctions between the roles/responsibilities of men and women while upholding their equal value/dignity.
</p>
<p>
The difference between this book and many others on complementarianism is that it spends less time justifying complementarian convictions from the Bible {'\u0028'}although it still manages to do this{'\u0029'}, and more time exploring how we should turn these convictions into positive church culture. I think it’s unlikely that long-time egalitarians will be convinced by the theological argument for complementarianism this book provides {'\u0028'}though they might{'\u0029'}. This book doesn’t seek to provide an exhaustive theological argument in the first place. Instead, this book narrows its goal: <em>“We want to strike a different tone: to embrace complementarianism as God’s good design and spend some time exploring what it looks like.”</em> 
</p>
<p>
Too often discussions around complementarianism are characterized by a negative tone and a focus on what people <em>shouldn’t</em> do in church. In contrast, I liked the positive tone of <i>Embracing Complementarianism</i>. While they avoid being overly prescriptive, Jane and Graham do tackle questions around preaching, service leading, bible study leading, and a whole host of other ministry roles. I won’t give away any of their answers—but I will say that Jane and Graham set out a compelling vision of men and women working together in ministry, in such a way that helps the church flourish. They have a great writing dynamic throughout the book too.
</p>
<p>
I think Christians should read this book, both men and women. While reading, it’s worth asking yourself—<em>does my church uphold the equal value of dignity of men and women, while living out God’s design for their distinct roles/responsibilities?</em>
