I read this book because it’s a recommended reading for third-year Philosophy at Moore College. I’m glad it is—it might sound strange, but I really enjoy reading stuff by atheists like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and so on. For one thing, they’re great writers and communicators. While it’s perhaps easier than it used to be to ‘make it’ as a popular atheistic author, you must be articulate and interesting to make a dent. These authors are—and they have. 
</p>
<p>
More than enjoying their writing abilities, I also think it’s important to see their arguments against religion and faith. In every church I’ve worked in there are at least some people wrestling with the popular arguments of atheism. To help them weigh the arguments well, it’s good for me to be across as much of it as possible. More personally, I myself have questions and beliefs about the world we live in, and I want to be open-minded to weigh up what experts in any field have to say. If someone has an argument so tight and compelling that it leaves no room to be a Christian anymore, I want to hear it! 
</p>
<p>
Why did Harris write this book? It’s a common view held by many religious and non-religious people alike that you cannot derive objective morals from scientific observation alone. Even many atheists hold—as the philosopher David Hume famously argued—that no description of the world {'\u0028'}facts{'\u0029'} can tell us how we ought to behave {'\u0028'}morals{'\u0029'}. In other words, you cannot simply go from an ‘is’ to an ‘ought’. Harris lays out these popular views early on and sets out to challenge them. 
</p>
<p>
In <i>The Moral Landscape</i>, Sam Harris argues that “questions about values—about meaning, morality, and life’s larger purpose—are really questions about the wellbeing of conscious creatures.” Harris argues that when viewed in this way, values translate into facts that can be scientifically understood, because “human wellbeing entirely depends on events in the world and on states of the human brain.” Harris’ broader goal is to “start a conversation about how moral truth can be understood in the context of science.” It’s interesting that he seems more concerned to convince secular colleagues about this as he is anyone else. 
</p>
<p>
I think Harris presents a compelling argument that <i>if</i> human wellbeing is simply a matter of states in the brain and events in the world, and <i>if</i> questions of morality are essentially questions about human wellbeing, then we don’t need to believe in ‘God’ or religion to inform our morality—all we need is science. However, I think these are big, unconvincing ‘if’s. No doubt some people will be persuaded by Harris’ argument, but I think most people won’t sign up to those initial premises he puts forward.
</p>
<p>
The premise that human wellbeing is simply a matter of states in the brain and events in the world raises all sorts of questions. For example, if someday, through advances in neuroscience, we could create a drug which turned hunger and hatred into the most pleasurable experiences one could have, would that be good? If everyone signed up to take the drug, starved themselves and turned on each other, would human wellbeing be globally achieved for the first time? This is a moral dilemma that exposes some of the issues with Harris’ first premise. To his credit, he does raise a similar hypothetical in the end notes, but with no satisfactory answer. Earlier in the book he argues that it seems desirable for our brain states to be tethered to events in the real world—and so for example, if one’s child died in an accident, most parents would refuse a drug which completely removed their sense of grief—grief is deemed a better response than apathy because it is tethered to reality. However, this isn’t explored thoroughly enough to provide a compelling answer.
</p>
<p>
The premise that questions of morality are essentially questions about human wellbeing is even more problematic. It only makes sense if we view ourselves as both the “subject” and the “object” of our lived experience. People who believe in a god {'\u0028'}or gods{'\u0029'} will call an individual’s sense of morality “subjective” and god’s morality—be it ‘Biblical’ or otherwise— “objective”, or perhaps “<i>the</i> objective”. Put simply, the way you view morality will depend on the way you view the universe. If God exists, there would be no way of knowing with confidence that morality is simply a question of human wellbeing as humans observe and define it. Unless—as Christians and people of some other faiths believe has happened—God reveals the ‘big picture’ to people.
</p>
<p>
Harris seems to know this. I think this is why he often finishes thoughts with a flurry of ‘reasons’ why religious worldviews must be false—normally in the form of a list of his least favourite beliefs and practices of Muslims, Jews and Christians. The Virgin Birth is a favourite least-favourite.
</p>
<p>
There are a few problems with this approach. The first problem is fairly straightforward—Harris lists beliefs that are either minority-held or not held at all by the people he attaches them to. For example, he’ll often say that the Bible condones slavery. However, most Christians will tell you they disagree with Harris’ assessment. I won’t provide a defense for why I disagree with Harris on slavery in the Bible—such a topic deserves more time and space—but if you want to explore more check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5KuKoVyob0">this</a> out. The point is—if you want to convince someone about something, you generally have to demonstrate that you’ve understood their viewpoint well enough that you can articulate it in a way they agree with. I say “generally” because Harris’ writing is so good that he’ll win many people over regardless.
</p>
<p>
The second reason why I think this approach lacks power is because people tend to hold ‘core’ beliefs and attached beliefs. Many Christians will say that a ‘core’ belief they hold is that the reports about Jesus’ life given by people who saw him in the first century are generally trustworthy. If Jesus’ words and actions—including his crucifixion and resurrection—are recorded accurately, that for many people is the ballgame. Peoples’ beliefs about angels, demons, and the like, bizarre as they may seem to non-believers, generally stem from a prior, core belief—at least in my experience. As a Christian, I know I don’t have all the answers. There are mysteries in my worldview still. Solely attacking these more mysterious beliefs fails to recognize where they stem from. Similarly, if I was to attack the respectability of atheism by highlighting the seemingly bizarre belief that “the universe came from nothing”, I’m confident I would not win over many people.
</p>
<p>
Although I fundamentally disagree with Harris, I appreciate his book and the way it pushes me to consider a radically different worldview. I am a big believer in science’s ability to expand our understanding of the universe, but I’m not convinced it has the power to determine morality. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it for anyone—atheist or believer—who wants to explore an atheist’s vision for a human morality determined by science.
