I read this book because it was highly recommended and because like many people I’m curious about why some nations seem to prosper materially while others don’t. I’m also interested to know where the global community of policy makers, philanthropists and researchers are up to in their thinking about global poverty. How high should our hopes be of drastically improving the lives of the world’s poorest in the 21st century?

Nobel prize winners and MIT economics professors Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo take readers on a journey through their findings over years of research in some of the world’s poorest places. The book has two parts, the first looking at the private lives of those in poverty, the second looking at institutions such as micro-finance organisations and local governments who theoretically have a part to play in helping the poor. The authors show that whether studying the private lives of the poor or the institutions meant to help them, there are strange details which demand attention.

The book doesn’t argue for a silver bullet policy that will make everyone prosper. Instead, it argues that in order to make progress in combatting global poverty, those involved must attend to details, understand how people make decisions, and be willing to experiment. The book raises and addresses many seemingly strange details along the way—a family without enough food but with a plasma-screen TV in their living room, 50% of teachers in Indian public schools not being in front of a class when they should be, farmers only investing in fertilizer if it is brought to their door at the right time. With great sympathy the book explores the mindset of those for whom saving makes little sense when the goal of a better life seems so far off. It explains why the poor bear responsibility for too many aspects of their lives, and why those in prosperous countries have the advantage of so many of life’s necessities being taken care of for us. It explains why micro-financing isn’t the silver bullet some people thought it was a decade ago, and why savings accounts are unpopular amongst the poor. Perhaps most importantly, it argues that poor countries are not doomed to failure just because they are poor, or because they have had an unfortunate history.

The book advocates for policies which nudge people in the right direction. Policy makers and program coordinators should incentivize parents to make good decisions for their kids. The perceived cost of not accessing proper health care should be higher than the cost of accessing it. Government corruption will always be a factor {'\u0028'}in a study of school grants in Uganda it was discovered that only 13 percent of allocated funds reached the schools{'\u0029'}, but even in larger institutions it is possible to ‘nudge’ people in the right direction.

Overall, the book helped me see that we are quite far off from knowing everything we can and need to know to adequately address global poverty. However there are things being done and things left to do—small yet impactful things—to alleviate the suffering experienced by billions of people around the world living in poverty. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding why so many in the world still face lives of poverty, and what’s happening to help them. For Christians I would argue that we are all called to take an active interest in the wellbeing of those who are “far off” {'\u0028'}geographically or otherwise{'\u0029'}, knowing that whether we care a little or a lot, we’re all called to be more like Jesus—who dwelled with, helped, and ultimately sacrificed himself for those who were far off.
