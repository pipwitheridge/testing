In my circles of Christian friends something keeps popping up in conversation. In fact, it's popped up in conversation for years now. I'm talking about the '5 M' church model.
</p>
<p>
The model comes from the idea that churches should be driven by their purpose. Churches should be more concerned with 'outputs' than 'inputs'. Churches should start with 'why' before planning the 'what' and 'how'. It makes a lot of sense. The '5 M' model refers to the five purposes that churches ought to have:
<li><strong>Magnify</strong>: We celebrate God's presence in worship</li>
<li><strong>Mission</strong>: We communicate God's Word through evangelism</li>
<li><strong>Membership</strong>: We incorporate God's family into our fellowship</li>
<li><strong>Maturity</strong>: We educate God's people through discipleship</li>
<li><strong>Ministry</strong>: We demonstrate God's love through service</li>
</p>
<p>
I've met more people who know what the 5 'M's stand for than people who know where they came from. For a long time I didn't know either. When I found out they came from a book by a guy named Rick Warren called <i>The Purpose Driven Church</i>, I knew I had to read it. After all, many Australian churches are adopting the model – the church I grew up in did so recently. It might sound strange to say, but this whole topic of church modelling is close to the heart!
</p>
<p>
Rick Warren is the pastor of one of the biggest churches in America: Saddleback Church in Orange Country, California. The book he is best known for is not <i>The Purpose Driven Church</i>, but <i>The Purpose Driven Life</i>. Most reputable websites have it in the top five best-selling Christian books of all time. In it, he outlines the five purposes for every Christian {'\u0028'}sound familiar?{'\u0029'}. What are the five purposes for every Christian? They're the exact same for the five purposes for every church as listed above. That is, the major purposes of the life of the Christian are the same purposes of the life of the church. It's not just a good model for the Christian individually, it's a good model for Christians gathered.
</p>
<p>
I'm not here to argue for or against this model. I'm writing to recommend reading <i>The Purpose Driven Church</i> and to share some thoughts on it.
</p>
<p>
The book opens with the incredible story of how Rick started Saddleback Church with his wife, Kay. In 1979, Warren conducted a study of the fastest growing regions of America and learned that nowhere was growing faster than Orange County, California. So, Warren and his wife drove to Orange County. They had no connections and no money. They arrived in Saddleback Valley at 5pm, went to a realtor's office and spoke to an agent named Don. "I'm here to start a church," Rick said. "I need a place to live but I don't have any money." Don grinned, laughed, and within two hours found Rick a place to stay and agreed to be the first member of his new church. And so it began.
</p>
<p>
If you think that sounds crazy, that's just the start of it. It's truly an incredible story – almost hard to believe. But belief is what fuelled Rick to start the church, and it seems God blessed it from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Rick didn't want transfer growth. He didn't want people moving to his church from other churches. He wanted people who didn't go to church. After moving to Saddleback Valley he spent the first twelve weeks going door-to-door talking to people. What started as a home church with Rick, Kay, and the realtor's family grew to fifteen people. Together they wrote an invitiation to the unchurched and sent it to 15,000 homes. They were going to launch their first service on Easter Sunday. Rick figured that if they could get a 1% response rate, 150 people would be at that service.
</p>
<p>
On Easter Sunday, 1980, 205 people turned up—mainly people who didn't go to church. Talk about bolting out of the gates. Today, forty-three years later, weekly attendance across their multiple campuses is estimated at around 25,000.
</p>
<p>
The book moves from the church's history to its philosophy. It outlines eight myths about big churches, such as:
<li>Myth #1: The only thing big churches care about is attendance.</li>
<li>Myth #3: You must choose between quality and quantity in your church.</li>
<li>Myth #5: If you are dedicated enough, your church will grow.</li>
</p>
<p>
Rick puts forward some probing questions for churches to ask themselves: "if most of our members never invite anyone to come to our church, what are they saying {'\u0028'}by their actions{'\u0029'} about the quality of what our church offers?"
</p>
<p>
Here's another excellent diagnostic question about the things we do at church: "Would we begin this today if we were not already doing it?"
</p>
<p>
Rick covers a bunch of bible passages to justify the '5 M' model, but he seems to lean on certain passages, such as Acts 2:42-47: 
</p>
<p>
<em>
"They <u>devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching</u> and to <u>fellowship</u>, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions <u>to give to anyone who had need</u>. 
Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <u>praising God</u> and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord <u>added to their number daily those who were being saved</u>."
</em>
</p>
<p>
Here, in order, we see these purposes at play: maturity, membership, ministry, magnification, mission. It's all happening in that passage, though there are other supporting passages also. Warren notes that there's nothing magical about the 'M's. You can use different words to express the same thing. For example, if you like 'E' more than 'M' you could use: exalt, evangelize, encourage, edify, equip. If you're not a slave to alliteration your options grow significantly.
</p>
<p>
The book then goes on to explain how everything the church does aims at these five purposes. Every aspect of the services, bible studies, courses, music, budget, staffing — it all reflects their desire to achieve these five aims.
</p>
<p>
Rick also argues that many churches unfortunately only aim at one of these things and neglect the others. The 'Soul-Winning' churches who only focus on mission. The 'Family-Reunion' churches who only focus on membership. The 'Bible Classroom' churches who only focus on maturity. The 'Social Conscience' churches who only focus on ministry. The 'Experience God' churches who only focus on magnification.
</p>
<p>
I really enjoyed this book—both for its entertainment value as well as its wisdom in thinking about church. It isn't without its controversial bits though. One of the things Saddleback Church is known for is its 'Seeker Sensitive' services which aim at non-Christians, arguably to the exclusion of Christians. Many argue this is a bad reflection of what church is really about {'\u0028'}See Paul Carter's <a href="https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/columns/ad-fontes/abandoned-seeker-church/">article</a> for example.{'\u0029'}
</p>
<p>
There's plenty of controversy surrounding Rick Warren and his ministry. Google him and find out. But I would still recommend reading this book, and I would encourage people to keep an open yet discerning mind as they read.
</p>
<p>
Maybe you're part of a '5 M' church and you're curious about where it came from. Maybe you're just curious about what all the fuss is about and you're not sure where to start. Maybe you just care about church being the best it can be, and you're looking for something stimulating to help reflect on church practice. Well, I recommend this book – while I don't agree with everything in it, I've found it very helpful and even entertaining.
