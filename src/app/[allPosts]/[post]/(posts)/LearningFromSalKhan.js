I first came across <a href="https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> when I was in high school. I scrolled through YouTube and found these 5–10-minute blackboard-style videos explaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaR1mPrdbTc">inflation</a> or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IR5LefXVPY&list=PLF83ACACC9F629C7D">GFC</a>. Maybe YouTube knew one of my subjects was Economics. Khan Academy began because Sal Khan—a former hedge fund employee turned online teacher—wanted to help his cousins with their schoolwork. He began making videos so that more of his extended family could access tutorials on how to approach specific maths problems and such. Over time more and more people watched his videos, and he built software to turn his small teaching channel into an educational platform where students could take courses, test themselves, track their progress and master content in a logical sequence.

I struggled with maths in high school and I didn’t think I had much of a ‘left brain’—the type of brain needed for things like science or computer programming. Nine years after finishing high school I decided to give computer programming a go. Why? A few reasons. Firstly, I have family and friends who are into computers, so I thought it’d be good to have some understanding of what they do all day. Secondly, people who work in Christian ministry {'\u0028'}like myself{'\u0029'} are often encouraged to have a hobby that gives some kind of instant feedback—playing a sport, playing video game—something where you can ‘win’ or at least know you’re on the right track. This is because in many Christian ministries, it’s hard to know if you’re ‘winning’ or even on the right track, because you’re primarily concerned with people and their growth. Are my congregation members growing in their faith? Are they growing in their relationships with their family? Are they growing in their love for God and those around them? These are not black-and-white things; it’s hard to analyse these outcomes. This kind of ‘spiritual growth’ can be incredibly slow and non-linear. And so, it's a good idea to have things in life which feed that part of the brain that needs instant feedback. I love sport and games, but I never expected that I’d enjoy computer programming. I knew it fit the category of a hobby that provided instant feedback (you can normally tell straight away if your code works or not by whether the page loads like you wanted). 
</p>


<p>
The third reason I decided to give it a go is a little more subtle. Part of the role of a pastor is to teach. The Bible says that leaders in church must be “able to teach” {'\u0028'}2 Tim. 2:4{'\u0029'}. How does a pastor teach their congregation? Many people would quickly say that <i>preaching</i> is how pastors teach. They deliver the Sunday sermon. That’s how they teach, and that’s how the congregation learns about God, the Bible, and the Christian life.

A couple years ago I came across a video by Sal Khan explaining why Khan Academy works. In essence, it works because it aims to teach students where they are at. It helps students master concepts before moving onto the next ones. By contrast, in traditional classroom schooling, the teacher tries to help a group of students understand a topic all at the same time. They sit an exam, and then move onto the next grade if they pass—whether you get 95%, 80% or 51% doesn’t matter. As time goes on, they learn new concepts which build on top of the concepts they learned previously. The problem is, if students only had a shallow understanding of previous concepts, they won’t get far with the advanced concepts which build on the initial foundations. In this sense, traditional classroom education can be represented with the following graph: 
</p>

<div className="d-flex justify-content-around mt-5"><Image alt="Time verses mastery image." style={{maxWidth: "400px", height: "auto"}} src={require('../../../../../public/images/timeVmasteryT.png')}></Image></div>


<p>
In the traditional approach, the variable that is constant is time: students sit in a classroom and learn the content at the same time together. This is efficient in face-to-face learning: one teacher can teach one lesson to many students. The variable that is volatile is the level of content mastery achieved by students. Some grasp concepts easily and excel, many achieve a basic grasp of the concepts, and a few sadly fall behind because they struggle to grasp the concepts. 
</p>


<p>
Doesn’t this happen in church, too? Isn’t it the case that on any given Sunday, a sermon is delivered to a congregation, some of whom will grasp the concepts at a deep level, many of whom will grasp the concepts at a somewhat basic level, and some for whom the concepts will simply go over their heads? 
</p>


<p>
Khan Academy—and many other forms of online learning—try to flip these variables around. Khan Academy has a large collection of short online videos, articles and quizzes to help students learn at their own pace. The idea is that students can increase their level of mastery by rewatching lessons when needed and revisiting concepts that they need to. In the ideal scenario, this form of education can be represented with the following graph: 
</p>

<div className="d-flex justify-content-around mt-5"><Image alt="Mastery verses time image." style={{maxWidth: "400px", height: "auto"}} src={require('../../../../../public/images/timeVmasteryM.png')}></Image></div>


<p>
Obviously, the ideal isn’t always achieved. Many students lack the motivation to watch the videos or do the exercises. Sal and the team at Khan Academy know this, and so what they advocate for is a kind of hybrid learning scenario, where students belong to a classroom with a real teacher, and it’s in this environment where they are encouraged and assisted to watch the videos. This way, students can still learn at their own pace, and many students can be watching different lessons at the one time, but there is still a teacher available to help and motivate.
</p>


<p>
It took me a few weeks to work my way through the Khan Academy Computer Programming course. It taught me enough about coding to help me start writing some programs for myself, and to continue learning coding through other avenues. Since learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I’ve been able to learn some more advanced Javascript, and have started to use some other frameworks and libraries. 
</p>


<p>
Khan Academy also taught me something about learning: that it is possible to learn complex concepts even if you’ve previously struggled with them. It encouraged me to have a ‘growth mindset’—to believe that with enough time and effort I can actually grasp difficult concepts and skills. Instead of saying “I’m bad at maths” it’s far better to say “I don’t know much about maths but I can learn.” 
</p>


<p>
Khan Academy also taught me something about teaching: that free, high-quality online material can be a great way to get people learning. Increasingly the world is moving towards online education while seeking to retain the benefits of learning in community {'\u0028'}face-to-face{'\u0029'}. I think this is a great thing. I think this applies to theological education too. There seems to be a gap in the market for free, high-quality, online theological education. There’s plenty of free low-quality stuff out there. There’s some expensive high-quality stuff out there. But as far as I can tell there’s nothing like a theological equivalent of Khan Academy. The closest I can think of is Bible Project’s <a href="https://bibleproject.com/classroom/">Classrooms</a>, but it simply is not the same. The lessons are long, lecture-style videos. They normally have long-winded introductions and the teaching content—while high in production value—doesn’t capture what people generally want from theological education: options to explore a variety of ancient texts, options to learn original languages, options to explore schools of thought outside the mainstream. As much as I like Bible Project generally, I think it has missed the mark somewhat with its Classrooms endeavour. I would be curious to know what the uptake has been like since it launched a year or so ago. 
</p>

<p>
Imagine your church comes out and says: “We now have an online learning platform where over time we’ll be uploading lessons on biblical studies, doctrine, Greek/Hebrew, church history, philosophy and ethics.” Not everyone would use it of course, but for the bunch of people who want to dive into topics or books of the Bible in their own time at their own pace, wouldn’t that be an exciting resource to have?
</p>



<p>
If you’re still reading, my encouragement would be to spend an hour or two trying out Khan Academy’s computer programming course. As you do so, think about how the style of teaching executed by Khan Academy could translate to other fields of study outside of the classic high-school curriculum {'\u0028'}such as theology{'\u0029'}. I really enjoyed using it—I hope you do too!
