At the time of writing, I can safely say I am no science whizz. Who knows what I might learn in the future, but for now, when it comes to science and maths, I'm an average joe. At best, I'm a slightly-above-average Steve.

Having said all that, I like reading/watching experts who help me think about how the universe got to be the way that it is. I think almost everyone has asked the question "where did the universe come from?", and while this book
can't answer that question, it explains where the scientific community is up to in its thinking about the universe's origins—or at least where it was up to when this book was published, first in 1988 then the later edition in 2011.

<i><strong>Side-note on Christians and attitudes toward science.</strong></i> There are some Christians who might take offense at the idea of a book that seeks to explain the nature and origins of space and time. They might quote Deuteronomy 29:29—“the secret things belong to God”. This attitude might come from a place of fear—fear that scientific explanations could erode our faith in God. It's true that as our understanding of the universe has evolved with scientific discovery, most people's view of the universe has shifted as well. As our view of the universe shifts, our conception of God might shift too. “The Earth revolves around the sun? Why Would God make it like that when <i>we</i> are supposed to be the centre of His plan for the universe?” Some people might believe that to retain a strong view of God, we must hold science loosely. However, I think the way a Christian views science says something about how they view God. If science is about seeing the universe around us and seeking to make sense of it based on repeatable experiments and observation, and if one believes in a God who is both orderly {'\u0028'}not random{'\u0029'} and truthful {'\u0028'}not deceptive{'\u0029'}—speaking in human terms of course—then we might expect them to take scientific discovery <i>more</i> seriously, not less. Additionally, a proper understanding of human beings as fallible creatures will make us more scientifically rigorous when it comes to evaluating other peoples’ observations, not less. In other words, a Christian worldview allows us to lean <i>into</i> science in the best possible way, not out of it. Not everyone sees it that way, and that’s alright.

In this classic, Hawking explores the expanding universe, the uncertainty principle, forces of nature, black holes, and more. There was much I didn’t understand, such as the concept of a singularity. “How can a whole universe worth of energy and information occupy an infinitely small piece of real estate?” I ask myself. I also struggle to understand the nature of the universe’s expansion, particularly right after the big bang. “How can the observable universe be over 90 billion lightyears in diameter, when the big bang supposedly only happened about 14 billion years ago? If nothing can move faster than the speed of light, ought the universe’s maximum observable width be capped at 14 billion light years?” I ask myself again. But Hawking was clear enough to help me understand some things better, and for that I’m grateful. From the perspective of Christian philosophy, one of the most interesting parts—and perhaps the most famous part—of the book was the conclusion, where Hawking talks about what it might take to discover why the universe exists. He says: “up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that describe <i>what</i> the universe is to ask the question <i>why</i>.” He goes on to say that if we can come up with a theory of the universe that adequately explains everything {'\u0028'}a unified theory, as some call it{'\u0029'} then philosophers, scientists and ordinary people alike would be able to discuss the question of why we and the universe exist. “If we found the answer to that,” Hawking says, “it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would know the mind of God.”

From a Christian perspective, I think it’s an open question whether we’ll ever achieve a unified theory like Hawking describes. One of Hawking’s closest colleagues during his career, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose#An_earlier_universe">Roger Penrose</a>, has since changed his mind about the big bang—maybe that’s going too far; he has <i>developed</i> his theory—to a view of the universe as cyclical, possibly eternal, consisting of multiple “big bangs” one after the other. This theory, known as conformal cyclic cosmology {'\u0028'}CCC{'\u0029'} has courted some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/10/08/no-roger-penrose-we-see-no-evidence-of-a-universe-before-the-big-bang/">controversy</a>. But it shows that the question of universal origins is a live question, and we are some way off from a unified theory.

I would recommend this book to anyone interested in science—even if, like me, you only know the basics. If you’re a Christian, I’d recommend it for at least two reasons: firstly, isn’t it a blessing to be able to study the universe God has made? And secondly, the more we understand scientific explanations of the universe, the better placed we’ll be to converse meaningfully with those who claim to deny God’s existence on the basis of science.
